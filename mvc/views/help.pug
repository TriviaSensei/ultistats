                h6 Setting a roster
                p This step is technically optional, but is highly recommended. Setting your roster allows you to quickly add players to a tournament roster. You may add or remove players at any time, and you may also add players for just a single tournament (which is covered #[a(href="#event-roster") here]). Your team may have up to 50 active players at a time, which allows you to set your main roster along with any practice players you may take to a limited number of events over the course of your season.
                p Add players to your roster by clicking on the "Roster" section. Set each player's name, display name (e.g. nickname), jersey number, gender (for mixed division teams), primary line (offense/defense), and their position (handler/cutter/hybrid). Click "Add Player" to save the player to your roster. Players may be removed or edited at any time. Removed players may be reinstated by adding a player with the same name and number. You may add players with the same jersey number to your roster, but a warning will be given (as governing bodies tend to disallow duplicate numbers on a roster).

                p When you create a team, you are, by default, its only team manager. While anyone who has a specialized link (explained #[a(href="#view-report") here]) may view your team's stats, team managers also have the following abilities: 
                ul 
                    li Edit team information 
                    li Invite other people to be team managers

                    li Enter team stats 
                p In order to invite a user to be your team's manager, that person must first have an UltiStats account, which is free and easy to obtain #[a(href="/signup") here]. After that, an existing team manager may request to add a manager by entering their e-mail address into the "Add Manager" field.
                img(src="/img/help/07_manager.png")
                p Add a manager 
                p The requested manager should receive an e-mail to confirm or decline being added as a team manager. Additionally, incoming manager requests will show up in your #[a(href="/me") profile] page.
                img(src="/img/help/08_request.png")
                p Team "Wendigo" has requested to add you to their list of managers.

                p You may always use the basic features of UltiStats for free (but #[a(href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/charlesyu4j") donations are appreciated]). To access some more advanced statistics, and graphical reports, you must have a subscription, which is $20 per team per year. Each team you manage must have a separate subscription. To manage your subscription, go to the subscription section under "Teams" in #[a(href="/mystuff") my stuff].
                img(src="/img/help/09_subscription.png")
                p Subscription features
                p Free subscriptions include stats on points played, goals, assists, turns, blocks, touches, and efficiency.
                p A Plus subscription grants you access to the following features, along with all features in the free version: 
                ul 
                    li #[strong 6 preset lines per event] - along with defaulting all players to offense or defense, you may preset 6 lines per event. Good for setting multiple O or D lines, or universe point lines for both offense and defense.
                    li #[strong Passing and receiving yards] - track not only which players are touching the disc the most, but also which ones are making the most of their touches.
                    li #[strong Plus/Minus] - which players, when on the field, are most correlated with the team scoring a point?
                    li #[strong Graphical reports] - graphical reports of the individual and team performances. See where possessions tend to go, where turnovers are happening, what kind of passes players are attempting and completing (or not completing), and which pairs of players tend to throw to each other.
                    li #[strong ...and more] - I am always open to suggestions for other reports and stats to include. Use the #[a(href="/contact") contact form] to suggest something. I would like this web app to be useful to you and your team, but this is also a learning experience for me as a developer and a (poor) statistician.

                p Normally, events are just individual tournaments, but you can create an event for just about any subset of your season, up to and including the entire thing. Want to keep stats on a scrimmage against your crosstown rivals? You can create an event for it, and just add a single game to it.
                p Each event is tied to a team. To create an event, select the "Events" tab from #[a(href="/mystuff") my stuff], select a team, and select "[Create new]" from the event selector.

                ul 
                    p #[strong Format] - the format of the event. Currently, only USAU (70-yard field with 20-yard endzones) is supported. WFDF formats can be recorded with this setting as well. In the future, we will look to add the AUDL ruleset, which uses a larger field and allows points to end without a score (at the end of a quarter).
                    p #[strong Game to] - the point cap of the game. Default 15 for USAU events.
                    p #[strong Win by] - A game ends if the point cap is reached and the leading team is ahead by at least this many goals. Default is 1.
                    p #[strong Hard cap] - The hard cap of a game. The game ends if either team reaches this score, regardless of margin of victory. Disabled if "win by" is 1.
                    p #[strong T/Os] - the number of timeouts allowed. Default is 2/half in USAU events, but you may also set this to 1/game, 1/half, or 1/half + a floater.

Your event roster can account for any players from your main roster that are not in attendance for this event. You may also add players to your main roster from this interface.

Use the "New" button to add a new player to your roster. This player will be added both to the tournament roster and to your main roster. The "add player" interface is explained #[a(href="#roster") here].

                h5 Setting event lines (➕)
                p With a Plus subscription, setting event lines allows you to quickly set up points during the heat of a game. Instead of individually selecting seven players for each point, select a preset line and populate your lineup with as little as two clicks.
                p To create a preset line, click on "Modify Lines". Give your line a name, select players for that line, and click "save". It is recommended that, for mixed teams playing under the USAU or WFDF standard formats, preset lines contain 6 players - 3 male-matching and 3 female-matching. This way, the seventh player may be added manually on each point, depending on the presecribed gender ratio.

Note that these will default to the event rules, but do not have to match exactly. This accounts for the fact that not every event has the same rules for every game. For example, pool play games may be played to 13 while the bracket is played to 15.

                    li Verify whether you are on offense or defense, your direction of attack, and (mixed only) the gender ratio. The tool can usually figure out these things (based on whether you scored the last point, the previous gender ratios, and your previous direction) but you may manually override these settings if necessary (e.g. if your statkeeper decides to move to the other side of the field between points, your direction of attack might change). You may not change these settings once a point starts.
                    li Your preset line (➕) - You may autopopulate a preset line (described #[a(href="#event-lines") here]) from this dropdown.

                    li Event description - the last recorded event. At the beginning of a point, it simply indicates the pulling and receiving team, but when on offense, will also indicate the last completed pass.
                    li Players - each of these represents one of the players on the field.
                    li Pass results - use these buttons to indicate the result of a pass (if something other than a regular completed pass)
                    li Miscellaneous - use these menus for miscellaneous occurrences. The events menu contains timeouts and injuries. The positioning menu is used when the disc needs to move to a specific location, such as the brick mark, or the goal line.

                        p Completing a pass. The interface indicates where the pass came from and where it went, the thrower and receiver, and the yards gained or lost.
                    li #[strong Stall] - stall button.
                    li #[strong Throwaway] - location on field, result. Do not enter an intended receiver.
                    li #[strong Drop] - location on field, intended receiver, result. Note that this will key in as a completed pass before you indicate that there was a drop. Also note that for some turnovers, you will have to decide whether it was a throwaway (thrower gets the blame) or a drop (receiver gets the blame). Only one player will have a turnover added to their stats.
                    li #[strong Goal] - location on field, receiver, goal. Note that this will key in as a completed pass before you indicate that there was a goal. If the pass that you keyed in did not go into the endzone, the goal button will be disabled. You will have to undo the pass and make sure that you touch the end zone. If you indicate that a pass was complete in the attacking end zone and then key in another pass, the previous pass will be assumed to have ended up on the goal line (e.g. the receiver caught the pass and ran into the end zone). If a goal is keyed (for either team), the interface will return to the point setup screen. You may use the undo button to undo a pass and return to the point until you set up the next point.
